## *Overview*

### Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* build `QFeatures` data structure
* extract components of a `QFeatures` data structure
* use functions supported by `QFeatures` package to process quantitative 
  proteomics data

### Anatomy of a `SummarizedExperiment` object

Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data can be representated as a 
matrix of quantitative values for features (PSMs, peptides, proteins) arranged 
along the rows, measured for a set of samples, arranged along the columns.
`SummarizedExperiment` class [@SE] handle this kind of tabular data.

These are the component pieces of the `SummarizedExperiment` for data representation.

```{r QF1, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SE.png")
```

### Anatomy of a `QFeatures` object

The `QFeatures` package [@Gatto:2020] is based on the `SummarizedExperiment` and `MultiAssayExperiment` classes and provides infrastructure to manage and analyse quantitative features from mass spectrometry experiments. It follows a hierarchical structure: *spectra* compose  *peptides* which in turn compose *proteins*. The main advantage of this structure is that is very easy to  navigate across spectra, peptide and protein quantitative data.

```{r QF2, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QF.png")
```

## *Reading data as `txt` file*

### obtaining peptide-level data, as processed by MaxQuant  [@Cox:2008].   

Read the peptide.txt file and locate the quantitative columns containing `"Intensity."`. This file is available on github and is a subset a subset of the CPTAC study 6 containing
conditions A and B [@Paulovich:2010]. 

```{r exp1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, message= FALSE}
f <- readr::read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgatto/bioc-ms-prot/master/data/cptac_peptides.txt",delim="\t")

```

```{r exp1-solution,message= FALSE}
f <- readr::read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgatto/bioc-ms-prot/master/data/cptac_peptides.txt",delim="\t")

(i <- grep("Intensity.", names(f)))

```

###

From the names of the columns, we see that the quantitative columns,
starting with `"Intensity."` (note the dot!) are at positions 56 to 61.

###

Great! Now we can read these data as a `QFeatures` object.


## *Reading data as `QFeatures`*

### use file and column information to create a QFeatures

Use the `readQFeatures` function to imported these data into R as an instance of class `QFeatures` named `cptac`. 

```{r exp2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
library("QFeatures")
cptac <- readQFeatures(___, ecol = ___, sep = ___, name = "peptides", fnames = "Sequence")

```

```{r exp2-hint-1}
library("QFeatures")
cptac <- readQFeatures(___, ecol = ___, sep = "\t", name = "peptides", fnames = "Sequence")
```

```{r exp2-hint-2}
library("QFeatures")
cptac <- readQFeatures(___, ecol = i, sep = "\t", name = "peptides", fnames = "Sequence")
```

```{r exp2-solution}
library("QFeatures")
cptac <- readQFeatures(f, ecol = i, sep = "\t", name = "peptides", fnames = "Sequence")
```

###

We also use the optional arguments `peptides` to name assay in the QFeatures object and `fnames` to set the row-names of the`peptides` assay to the peptide sequences.

## *colData*
 
### sample information

Use the `colData` function to see description of each sample from `cptac`

```{r exp3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
cptac
```

```{r exp3-solution}
colData(cptac)
```

###

We see that this experiment has not been annotated yet, so will need to annotate with the experimental desing.

## *Annotating the experiment*
 
### Encoding the experimental design

We can update the sample (column) annotations to encode the two
groups, 6A and 6B, and the original sample numbers.

```{r exp3b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
cptac$group <- rep(c("6A", "6B"), each = 3)
cptac$sample <- rep(7:9, 2)
```

```{r exp3b-solution}
cptac$group <- rep(c("6A", "6B"), each = 3)
cptac$sample <- rep(7:9, 2)
colData(cptac)
```
###
Awesome! We have made and annotate our first `QFeatures`!

###

This `QFeatures` object is ready for downstream processing. We can explore other elements of the SummarizedExperiment class before doing so.  


## *rowData*
 
### metadata information

Use the `rowData` function to see the metadata information from `cptac`

```{r exp4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
cptac
```

```{r exp4-solution}
rowData(cptac)
```

## *assay*
 
### matrix-like container 

Use the `assay` function to get a matrix-like `cptac`

```{r exp5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
cptac
```

```{r exp5-solution}
assay(cptac) %>% head(2)
```

###
The rows represent features of interest (e.g. peptides) and columns represent samples (with sample data summarized as a DataFrame). 


## *assays*

### data representation as a 'List'

We can also extract the list of data within the object by using the `assays` function.

Now use the `class` function on the output of the `assays` function.

```{r exp6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
assays(cptac)
```

```{r exp6-solution}
    assays(cptac) %>% 
  class()
```

### SimpleList

The `SimpleList` class is an `S4Vectors` representation of `List`s with metadata. The length of this `SimpleList` is 1, since there is only one assay in this dataset (but there could be more in experiments such as single cell proteomics) . 


## *Filtering out contaminants*
 
### `filterFeatures` function to filter `QFeatures` contaminants

Use the `filterFeatures` function to filter contaminants in `cptac`

```{r exp7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
library("magrittr")
cptac_filter <- cptac %>%
    filterFeatures(~ Reverse == "") %>%
    filterFeatures(~ Potential.contaminant == "")
```

```{r exp7-solution}
library("magrittr")
cptac_filter <- cptac %>%
    filterFeatures(~ Reverse == "") %>%
    filterFeatures(~ Potential.contaminant == "")
```

###
Compare number of rows of `cptac` which is `r dim(assay(cptac))[1]` with number of rows of `cptac_filter` which is `r dim(assay(cptac_filter))[1]`

## *Bonus*

### Further downstream analysis 

Please see [QFeatures](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/) website for further downstream analysis

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r expers, echo = FALSE}
question(" What function do you use to extract the matrix-like information from cptac?",
    answer("Assay", message = "Remember, R is case sensitive!"),
    answer("assay", correct = TRUE),
    answer("assays", message = "Not quite! This is a `SimpleList` which length is equal to the number of QFeatures."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
