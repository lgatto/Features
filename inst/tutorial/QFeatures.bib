  abstract = "Optimal performance of LC-MS/MS platforms is critical to
              generating high quality proteomics data. Although individual
              laboratories have developed quality control samples, there is no
              widely available performance standard of biological complexity
              (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform
              performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across
              different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations
              of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used
              extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to
              characterize LC-MS platform performance. The yeast proteome is
              uniquely attractive as a performance standard because it is the
              most extensively characterized complex biological proteome and
              the only one associated with several large scale studies
              estimating the abundance of all detectable proteins. In this
              study, we describe a standard operating protocol for large scale
              production of the yeast performance standard and offer aliquots
              to the community through the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology where the yeast proteome is under development as a
              certified reference material to meet the long term needs of the
              community. Using a series of metrics that characterize LC-MS
              performance, we provide a reference data set demonstrating
              typical performance of commonly used ion trap instrument
              platforms in expert laboratories; the results provide a basis for
              laboratories to benchmark their own performance, to improve upon
              current methods, and to evaluate new technologies. Additionally,
              we demonstrate how the yeast reference, spiked with human
              proteins, can be used to benchmark the power of proteomics
              platforms for detection of differentially expressed proteins at
              different levels of concentration in a complex matrix, thereby
              providing a metric to evaluate and minimize pre-analytical and
              analytical variation in comparative proteomics experiments.",
